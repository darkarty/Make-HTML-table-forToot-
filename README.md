python script to create html table, using same style as original table. 

for use on ubc legacy project interviewee page.

puts people in alphabetical order based on their last names, and also inserts A - Z anchors.

steps:

- update people in input.py (script will automatically sort people by last name)

- run main.py

- output.html should have the newly generated table

notes:
- First letter of last name needs to be capitlized to be sorted 'correctly', becauses the sort considers A-Z to be before a-z
